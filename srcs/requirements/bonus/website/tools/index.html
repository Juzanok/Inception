			<p>1. "The key to success is failure."</p>
			<p>2. "I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times,
				I'vebeentrusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my
				life. And that is why I succeed."</p>
			<p>3. "Failure makes me work even harder."</p>
			<p>4. "I've never been afraid to fail."</p>
			<p>5. "I know fear is an obstacle for some people, but it is an illusion to me. Failure always made me try
				harder next time."</p>
			<p>6. "I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying."</p>
			<p>7. "My attitude is that if you push me towards something that you think is a weakness, then I will turn
				that perceived weakness into a strength."</p>
			<p>8. "Obstacles dont have to stop you. If you run into a wall, dont turn around and give up. Figure out
				how to climb it, go through it, or work around it."</p>
